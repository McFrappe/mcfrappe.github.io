                                measurement instruments are small and require high precision. A single measurement
                                session
                                can
                                often contain a large amount of samples, which is why it is crucial to automate this
                                process.
                                The solution, which is discussed in this report, is a Graphical User Interface that
                                allows a
                                user to control three linear motors that can move in the X-, Y-, and Z-axis. Movement of
                                the
                                motors results in the movement of the sampling platform, which allows a measurement
                                instrument
                                to be inserted and ejected from each sample with a much higher precision than a human is
                                capable
                                of. Automating the process does not only result in a more accurate and precise
                                measurement
                                process, but also a more efficient process, since the sample size can be decreased. By
                                decreasing the sample size, it is also possible to increase the number of samples to
                                perform
                                measurements on. The results shows an increase in accuracy and a reduction of the
                                required
                                supervision over the sampling process. Moreover, our solution also reduces power
                                consumption
                                since the equipment used in the analyses requires less uptime.

                        I took a course in 2021 Q2 called "Computer systems and project work" where we implemented an
                        application that connects the student with the student nations in Uppsala, Sweden. This was done
                        with
                        the help of a
                        four part system where there was an admin web app, mobile application and a backend with an
                        in-house
                        built SDK for communication between the backend and frontend. I worked with backend and SDK.
